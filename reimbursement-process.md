# Reimbursement Process

Thanks to the Sloan Foundation grant that supports the URSSI Schools on Research Software Engineering, we can reimburse you for your travel expenses (excluding the hotel stay, which should have been directly billed to Oregon State).

**Oregon State folks**: please submit a travel reimbursement request using Concur, using the index F1211B.

1. Everyone should have received an invitation to register as a vendor through OSU's BennyBuy system. If you are asked for a job title / role, you can say "workshop participant". Please make sure you complete this ASAP!
2. Separately from the BennyBuy system, download and add your personal information and travel expenses to the ["Non-OSU Travel Reimbursement - URSSI.pdf" form](./Non-OSU%20Travel%20Reimbursement%20-%20URSSI.pdf), which has been pre-populated with some information. 
  - Add your personal info (leave "OSU ID#" blank)
  - In Travel Itinerary section, add your home city. Modify the dates you left and returned home if different.
  - In the Meals section, for Friday 5 January, change to "Yes" if you did not attend the group dinner. If your travel dates are different, you'll need to modify to account for that.
  - Skip the "Claiming Meals at Actual Cost" section.
  - On the next page, if you drove to Portland, add the dates and mileage to the "Personal Vehicle Mileage" section.
  - In the "Other Travel Expenses" section, add your airfare or ground transportation costs (such as train, bus, public transit). Use "Ground Transportation" if you took rideshare or taxi to get to/from PDX.
  - If you run out of space in "Ground Transportation", you can use the "Other" lines.
  - Use "Parking" if you parked at your home airport (we only allow economy parking).
3. Make sure to total up sections if the PDF doesn't do it automatically, then add the total reimbursement amount at the end, to the line with the index and account code specified.
3. You'll need to attach receipts for all expenses above $25, aside from the per diem meals.
4. Please email a single PDF to Bingxin Lin <bingxin.lin@oregonstate.edu> with the subject line "Reimbursement request for URSSI Winter School". You can also email Bingxin with any questions about the reimbursement form.
