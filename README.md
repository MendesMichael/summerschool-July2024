## Code of Conduct

We have adopted a [code of conduct](https://github.com/si2-urssi/winterschool/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for the URSSI Winter School and all associated spaces, both physical and digital. Please review this.

Also, the URSSI Winter School is a scent-free environment. We would like to ask the participants to refrain from using any scented lotions, perfumes, essential oils, scented antiperspirants, etc., as these make the space inaccessible for folks with asthma, allergies to the scents, or with Multiple Chemical Sensitivity. Having a scent-free environment will help prevent dizziness, nausea, breathing difficulties, headaches, and other issues among our participants.

## Requirements

You will need a laptop with a Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.) that you have administrative privileges on, and need some specific software packages installed:

- the Bash shell; you should only have to set this up if you are using a Windows machine, following the [Software Carpentry setup instructions](http://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#setup)
- Git
- Python 3.x; we recommend installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
- a text editor, preferably one designed for writing code; we recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), [Atom](https://atom.io), or [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com)

You should also sign up for a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account if you don't already have one.

Specific Python packages (install with pip or conda):
- pytest
- sphinx

## Projects

Most of your work time will be spent on an individual project where you develop a Python-based research software package.
Please bring an idea or some basis for a project.

Ideally, this should be something that supports your work and that you would (or could) continue developing or using after the winter school.
We hope that most—or at least some—of the projects will eventually be submitted to the [Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS)](https://joss.theoj.org), which we'll briefly talk about on the final day.

## Reimbursements

Please follow the instructions you will receive over email and reach out to Kyle Niemeyer with any questions or concerns.
